# Git Branching Strategy

We use the following branching strategy for this project:

- **Main branch**: Contains production-ready code.
- **Feature branches**: Used for developing new features.
- **Hotfix branches**: For urgent fixes to the main branch.

All changes are merged into the main branch via pull requests.
